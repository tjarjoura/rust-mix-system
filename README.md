# MIX Systems Tooling

This project aims to create various tools for the fictional machine MIX as laid out by Donald Knuth in the original version of The Art of Computer Programming, not to be cofused with MMIX, the successor machine created in later additions.

## Why am I doing this?

My goals are:
- To learn Rust
- To learn systems programming
- To study the material of The Art of Computer Programming
- To understand the historical development of machine architecture
- Personal interest and enjoyment

## Current Status

Currently I've started implementation of an assembler for the MIXAL assembly language.
